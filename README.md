# Hello Country React App for Mobile Visual Testing Tutorial

## Overview

This project is a responsive demo app build with React. During the Mobile Visual Testing tutorial, we will see how visual bugs can be especially prominent for responsive applications when platform changes take place.
 
To illustrate, we will first look at a desktop version of the app as shown on Figure 1.

Then, we observe Figure 2 where the same app is shown on iPhone 5 with dimensions 320x568. When the app is viewed on mobile, the country's flag is supposed to be hidden.

Lastly, we demonstrate how in some case like shown on the Figure 3, for some devices with an unexpected dimension like iPhone X (375x812) visual bugs can appear while functionally the app can perform as usual (i.e. button is clickable, country changes)
